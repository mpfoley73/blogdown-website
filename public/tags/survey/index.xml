      <description>The Pew Research Center recently published the results of its 2020 survey of 3,535 adults, exploring the importance of cultural origins among various racial/ethnic groups. The data is available (with a free account) from the Pew site. Pewâ€™s main finding was that Black and Hispanic adults are more likely that White adults to feel connected to their roots and regard them as central to their identity. I wonder whether this finding holds generally throughout the Black and Hispanic communities, or whether the importance of roots is also a function of other factors, such as political ideology, level of education, and age.</description>
