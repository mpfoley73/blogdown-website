      <description>Everyone complains that major league baseball games take too long. I agree. The average Cleveland Indians baseball game lasted 3 hours and 5 minutes in 2021. That’s about 1 hour longer than I’d prefer. It hasn’t always been this way. Up until WW II, games lasted only about 2 hours.
I compiled that figure using data from Baseball-Reference.com. The data on Baseball-Reference is fantastic, but you do have to work a little to get it into useable form.</description>
