      <description>I enjoy music from Rush and Queen. Queen has more listenable songs, and some of their early work is especially creative, both musically and lyrically. But in general, Rush features stronger lyrics. Rushâ€™s drummer and lyricist, Neil Peart, drew from a wide range of source material and employed an impressive vocabulary. Freddie Mercury, the lead singer from Queen, was not quite as creative.</description>
