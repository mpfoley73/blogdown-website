Buffer published [The 2021 State of Remote Work](https://buffer.com/2021-state-of-remote-work), a summary of a survey of over 2,000 remote workers in late 2020. The report was a follow up to the [2020 report](https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020) which was featured in [MakeoverMonday](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w32). Buffer made the [2021 report data]("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aJFW-_Rq3xNa2Fos-raoA1sF23CwT9sLAfHopjMZnLs/edit?usp=sharing") available as a Google sheets file on Google Docs.

The Buffer survey found that workers overwhelmingly support remote work. However, they did share struggles such as difficulty unplugging from the office, collaborating, and loneliness. I was curious about what factors impact their struggles.

The difficulty here is that _all_ of the predictor variables are categorical.

My project code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/mpfoley73/remote-work), and the knitted output is [here](/projects/remote-work/).
