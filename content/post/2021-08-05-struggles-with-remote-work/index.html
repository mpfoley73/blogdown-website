<p>Buffer published <a href="https://buffer.com/2021-state-of-remote-work">The 2021 State of Remote Work</a>, a summary of a survey of over 2,000 remote workers in late 2020. The report was a follow up to the <a href="https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020">2020 report</a> which was featured in <a href="https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w32">MakeoverMonday</a>. Buffer made the <a href="%22https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aJFW-_Rq3xNa2Fos-raoA1sF23CwT9sLAfHopjMZnLs/edit?usp=sharing%22">2021 report data</a> available as a Google sheets file on Google Docs.</p>
<p>The Buffer survey found that workers overwhelmingly support remote work. However, they did share struggles such as difficulty unplugging from the office, collaborating, and loneliness. I was curious about what factors impact their struggles.</p>

<p>The difficulty here is that <em>all</em> of the predictor variables are categorical.</p>
<p>My project code is on <a href="https://github.com/mpfoley73/remote-work">GitHub</a>, and the knitted output is <a href="/projects/remote-work/">here</a>.</p>
