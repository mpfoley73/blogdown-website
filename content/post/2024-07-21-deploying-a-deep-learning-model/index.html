<p>Today I fine tuned an image recognition deep learning model, created a web interface with Gradio, and deployed it on Hugging Face Spaces. This project was the subject of lesson 2 of fast.ai’s <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Deep Learning for Coders</a> course.</p>
<div id="fine-tuning-a-model-in-kaggle" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Fine-tuning a Model in Kaggle</h2>
<p>Deep learning models need to train on a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) because CPUs are too slow. I followed fast.ai’s recommendation to use Kaggle (Google Colab, AWS, and Microsoft Azure) are popular alternatives. Kaggle was particularly convenient because I was able to find a curated dataset there. After logging into Kaggle, I searched for “dog breed image” and came across <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikhushikhushi/dog-breed-image-dataset">this one</a> posted by Khushi. I clicked “New Notebook” to create a project with the data already loaded into the environment.</p>

<p>It’s in the Input &gt; Datasets section of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/mpfoley73/dog-breed-classification">my notebook</a>. The full path is <code>/kaggle/input/dog-breed-image-dataset</code>.</p>
<p><img src="kaggle-notebook.png" width="700" style="border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); border: 2px solid #ccc; transition: transform 0.2s;"></p>
<p>My notebook follows <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/02_production.ipynb">chapter 2</a> of the fast.ai book. My notebook is self-documented, so I won’t step through each cell. But the upshot is that fast.ai provides a super-convenient framework for fitting a model. There is not much code in my notebook. Here are the highlights though:</p>
<p>Using fast.ai’s <code>DataBlock()</code> method, I created a DataLoader object that defines how manage the data: how it is structured, how to create the train/test split, any required transformations, etc. I used the object to load the dog breed data set, then passed it into <code>vision_learner()</code> to create a learner object and fine tune a ResNet-18 model on the data with <code>fine_tune()</code>. The model can then predict on new images using the <code>predict()</code> method. Now that the model was fine-tuned, I exported it to a pickle file with the <code>export()</code> method. I downloaded the pickle file from Kaggle to my laptop.</p>
<pre><code>from fastai.vision.all import *

parent_dir = &#39;/kaggle/input/dog-breed-image-dataset/dataset&#39;

dogs = DataBlock(
    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), 
    get_items=get_image_files, 
    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),
    get_y=parent_label,
    item_tfms=[RandomResizedCrop(224, min_scale=0.5)],
    batch_tfms=aug_transforms()
)

dls = dogs.dataloaders(parent_dir)

learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate)

learn.fine_tune(4)

learn.predict(&#39;/kaggle/input/dog-breed-image-dataset/dataset/Beagle/Beagle_1.jpg&#39;)

learn.export(&#39;dog_breed_classifier.pkl&#39;)</code></pre>

<h2>2. From Notebook to App with Gradio</h2>
<p>Gradio is a Python library that allows you to quickly create user-friendly web interfaces for machine learning models. You can create an interface in just a few lines of code. Tanishq Abraham posted <a href="https://www.tanishq.ai/blog/posts/2021-11-16-gradio-huggingface.html">an article</a> walking through the steps. Here is my experience.</p>
<p>I created a folder on my laptop and copied in the pickle file I had downloaded. I also grabbed a photo of Chester to use as an example.</p>
<p>I opened VS Code and created a new file named app.py. The full file is on <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mpfoley73/fastai_dog_breed_classifier/blob/main/app.py">Hugging Face</a>, but here is the stripped down code:</p>
<pre><code>import gradio as gr
from fastai.vision.all import *
import skimage
import pathlib

# Uncomment this for local (Windows) development.
# Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57286486/i-cant-load-my-model-because-i-cant-put-a-posixpath
#
# posix_backup = pathlib.PosixPath
# try:
#     pathlib.PosixPath = pathlib.WindowsPath
#     learn = load_learner(&#39;dog_breed_classifier.pkl&#39;)
# finally:
#     pathlib.PosixPath = posix_backup
#
# Uncomment this for Hugging Face
learn = load_learner(&#39;dog_breed_classifier.pkl&#39;)

labels = learn.dls.vocab
def predict(img):
    img = PILImage.create(img)
    pred,pred_idx,probs = learn.predict(img)
    return {labels[i]: float(probs[i]) for i in range(len(labels))}

<p>If you compare my code to Tanishq’s blog, you will notice some small differences related to changes in the <code>gradio</code> library. Also, notice the comment block that reconciles the path differences between Hugging Face and my laptop. When you run the script, you get a notification in the terminal like this:</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\Users\mpfol\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\fastai_dog_breed_classifier&gt; &amp; C:/Users/mpfol/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/python3.11.exe c:/Users/mpfol/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/fastai_dog_breed_classifier/app.py

<p>VS Code has spawned a local web site to run the app. Open the link!</p>

<h2>3. From Local App to Hugging Face</h2>
<p>The last step is to publish the app to Hugging Face Spaces so that it is publicly viewable. Continuing with Tanishq’s tutorial, I created an account at Hugging Face, then created a new Space. This is essentially a git repository on Hugging Face. I called my space <code>fastai_dog_breed_classifier</code>.</p>
<p>In VS Code, I opened the Terminal and changed directory into by GitHub repos area. Then I cloned the repo.</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\Users\mpfol\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub&gt; git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/mpfoley73/fastai_dog_breed_classifier  </code></pre>
<p>The Hugging Face <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/repositories-getting-started#terminal">Getting Started with Repositories</a> article explains that you need <code>git-lfs</code> for large files like our pickle file.</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\Users\mpfol\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub&gt; git lfs install</code></pre>
<p>I copied my <code>app.py</code>, the pickle file, and Chester’s photo into my local GitHub directory. Then I committed the whole thing and pushed it up to Hugging Face.</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\Users\mpfol\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\fastai_dog_breed_classifier&gt; git commit -am &quot;initial commit&quot;
PS C:\Users\mpfol\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\fastai_dog_breed_classifier&gt; git push</code></pre>
<p>The Hugging Face repo is <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mpfoley73/fastai_dog_breed_classifier/tree/main">here</a>. After pushing the commit, Hugging Face immediately began deploying my app <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mpfoley73/fastai_dog_breed_classifier">here</a>.</p>
<p>And that was all I needed to do!</p>
<p><em>A final note: this actually took me over 10 hours spread over a few weeks. Almost nothing worked right without a lot of time and hair pulling. My notes make it seem simple, but it’s only simple after you’re done. Thank you, fastai, and Tanishq, and the other online resources!</em></p>
