title: About
---

I am a data analyst at Progressive Insurance where I ensure Progressive meets its recruiting, retention, performance, and inclusion goals. I specialize in statistical analysis and work primarily with R. I frequently build interactive reports with Tableau.

I live in Cleveland Heights, OH. When I'm not working with data, I enjoy discovering Cleveland with my wife, and rooting for the Guardians at Progressive Field.
